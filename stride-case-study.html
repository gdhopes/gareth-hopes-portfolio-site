        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>Running can be difficult... There are a lot of things to consider, from how to perfect your foot strike, right down to how to breathe properly. For your average runner it can often feel like...
          "am I doing this right...am I doing more harm than good?"
          During 2020 with the pandemic affecting exercise habits across the globe, running became the go-to exercise, as all you need is yourself and a pair of trainers. Fitness was a hot topic.
          The problem is that the online world is saturated with generic advice and if the content doesnâ€™t speak to you directly it can be easy to feel disheartened or even worse, cause an injury.</p>

        <p>During March and April during 2020 especially, the search term was at it's strongest point.</p>
        <h3>The Solution</h3>
        <p>To provide a platform where running progress is a personalised experience, tailored specifically to the user, offering them a personal coach along with a motivational community experience.
          We will know this to be true when our users subscribe to our coaches, or create their own communities and they achieve their running goals in a more efficient manner by doing so.</p>

        <h3>The Competition</h3>
        <p>My first step was to take a look at the competition, to see what services other running apps provided and to gauge what opportunities were available.
          Through this process, it became clear that although there is a lot of professional advice available, none of it is personal to the user. The advice offered is generic, leaving a gap in the market for my product.

        <h3>User Research</h3>
        <p>In continuing my research into existing products and user habits, I reached out to interview 3 potential users, each of them a runner, but in their own unique way.
The sessions were held via Skype and using a prewritten script and I asked questions around the topics below, where you see my findings and the ideas that came out of these sessions
