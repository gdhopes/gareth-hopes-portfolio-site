        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>Running can be difficult... There are a lot of things to consider, from how to perfect your foot strike, right down to how to breathe properly. For your average runner it can often feel like...
          "am I doing this right...am I doing more harm than good?"
          During 2020 with the pandemic affecting exercise habits across the globe, running became the go-to exercise, as all you need is yourself and a pair of trainers. Fitness was a hot topic.
          The problem is that the online world is saturated with generic advice and if the content doesn’t speak to you directly it can be easy to feel disheartened or even worse, cause an injury.</p>

        <p>During March and April during 2020 especially, the search term was at it's strongest point.</p>
        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <p>To provide a platform where running progress is a personalised experience, tailored specifically to the user, offering them a personal coach along with a motivational community experience.
          We will know this to be true when our users subscribe to our coaches, or create their own communities and they achieve their running goals in a more efficient manner by doing so.</p>

        <h2>The Competition</h2>
        <p>My first step was to take a look at the competition, to see what services other running apps provided and to gauge what opportunities were available.
          Through this process, it became clear that although there is a lot of professional advice available, none of it is personal to the user. The advice offered is generic, leaving a gap in the market for my product.

        <h2>User Research</h2>
        <p>In continuing my research into existing products and user habits, I reached out to interview 3 potential users, each of them a runner, but in their own unique way.
          The sessions were held via Skype and using a prewritten script and I asked questions around the topics below, where you see my findings and the ideas that came out of these sessions

        <h2>User Personas</h2>
        <p>The information obtained so far enabled me to craft 2 strong user personas that I felt best represented the sentiments passed over from the interviews along with the target audience for the app</p>

    <div class="section">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>User Flows</h2>
        <p>In order to start working on the design, I needed to decide on how the users would interact, what journeys they would take and what would be the most important features to them.
          During the interview process, several of the interviewees mentioned how they enjoyed the social aspects of running apps, such as sharing runs, seeing what other runners are doing etc.
          This is when I came up with the concept of the app having a 'Run Clubs' feature, where, instead of sharing and connecting via an external app, users could create their very own in-app communities, something that would also be great to
          motivate each other. This started with the concept of the task flow below</p>
        <picture>
          <source srcset="img/stride/user_flows.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
          <img src="img/stride/user_flows@2x.png" alt="user_flows">

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Information Architecture</h2>
        <p>In order to understand how the users would perceive the architecture of the app, I sketched out the initial sitemap and followed it up by testing it using a card sort.
          I decided to use an open sort in order to understand if the users would arrive to a similar median as my original hypothesis when it came to the number of categories and their names</p>
        <picture>
          <source srcset="img/stride/site_map_sketch.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
          <img src="img/stride/site_map_sketch@2x.png" alt="site_map_sketch">
        </picture>
        <p>The second step was to take the Category headings from my original Sitemap and to match them with the Categories that the participants had used.
          In the image below, the y axis (vertical) shows the content listed in their initial Sitemap Categories and the x axis (horizontal) shows the Participants data on how they labelled each one.
          I reviewed the data and highlighted in green where the users Category heading was the same or similar to mine.
          Then, in the ‘Match’ Column at the end of the table, you can see how many participants chose a similar heading. A total of 5 or more out of the 10 determined that the initial Sitemap Category worked and did not need to be changed. Anything
          under 5 needed to be reviewed further.</p>
        <picture>
          <source srcset="img/stride/info_arc_matrix.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
          <img src="img/stride/info_arc_matrix@2x.png" alt="info_arc_matrix">
        </picture>
        <p>The data shows that there were definitely sections of initial sitemap that needed to be changed. The participants results only really matched up in terms of categorizing ‘Content’ The rest of the categorisation was spread out.
          The Dendrograms below show the high level Categories that the content was placed under. Here it becomes clearer to see that there is a need for new Tier 1 Categories to be created for ‘Clubs’ and also for ‘Challenges’.
          It can also be seen that Participants grouped the majority of the ‘personal’ Categories together, eg. ones that begin with ‘MY’. These were grouped together under either ‘My Account’ or ‘Profile’.
          Some of the content was mixed in with the media Categories and I think this was due to poor wording on my part or users misunderstanding the content of the feature in question</p>
        <picture>
          <source srcset="img/stride/dendo.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
          <img src="img/stride/dendo@2x.png" alt="dendrograms">
        </picture>
        <p>I took the information above and Categorized it as can be seen below. This now represents a closer interpretation of what the Participants had outlined in the results.</p>

          <source srcset="img/stride/site_map_list.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
          <img src="img/stride/site_map_list@2x.png" alt="site_map_list">
        </picture>
        <p>I took the executive decision to arrange the ‘account’ section into a different format.
          This decision was taken based on some poor site headings and also to group similar categories together. These changes are outlined in the new Sitemap below

        <h2>Mid-Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
        <p>Now that I had the hypothesized user flows for 2 of the main features of the app it was time to start on the basis of how the design would look.
          Using Adobe XD I crafted the designs below mirroring the 2 user flows from the previous section. I choose to use greyscale to allow for more focus on the navigation and task rather than the design at this point</p>

        <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
        <p>Using the mid-fidelity prototype I was now able to test the hypothesis regarding my design. I set up 6 user moderated interviews using a pre-planned script, where the interviewees would be asked to complete tasks based around the 2 main
          features</p>

        <h2>A/B Testing</h2>
        <p>I also took the opportunity to perform a quick A/B Test using some higher fidelity versions of the home screen, as I wanted to determine which word suited the 'RUN' button. Which term would help users to recognise that this was the CTA for
          starting their run.</p>

        <h2>My Learnings</h2>
        <h3>Test it, then Test it again</h3>
        <p>I made a lot of early assumptions and hypothesise that were immediately discredited during testing. This taught me that whenever an idea occurs, test it...</p>
        <h3>Don’t Fall in Love</h3>
        <p>When you are working on a design for so long it can be so easy to get attached to it. I learnt that you can get personal about it, but fall in love with its purpose and how it will be used instead.</p>
        <h3>Iteration Is Key</h3>
        <p>Rome wasn't built in a day, and as such, your product won't be either. Lay one brick at a time, build slowly and make iterations to ensure that the foundation is always there.</p>
        <h3>Don't Fall Into The Rabbit Hole</h3>
        <p>It became easy to get lost at times and become unproductive. I learnt that collaboration, sharing your work and getting feedback are key at times. 2 heads are better than 1. It can give you that little spark you need to push forward.</p>
        <h3>Your Personas Are Your Best Friends</h3>
        <p>Always keep your personas in mind and keep their profiles close by. Ensure that their needs are always in mind throughout the entire design process.</p>
